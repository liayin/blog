Many data repositories require hard drive encryption. One of the software that can encrypt an entire hard drive is DiskCryptor. Their most recent build was a beta published on April 27, 2020. On their GitHub page, they suggested that we keep a backup and a Windows 2 Go drive on hand just in case.

There are instructions for creating a disk backup [here](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-make-full-backup-windows-10), and for creating a bootable drive [here](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-create-windows-10-usb-bootable-media-uefi-support).
