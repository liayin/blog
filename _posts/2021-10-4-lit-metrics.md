### Causal Inference
[Roth (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1257/aeri.20210236): Pretest with Caution: Event-Study Estimates after Testing for Parallel Trends
- AERI
- This paper points out two limitations to the test for parallel trends
    - Conventional pretests may have low power, meaning that preexisting trends that produce meaningful bias in the treatment effects estimates may not be detected with substantial probability
    - Conditioning the analysis on the result of a pre-trends test induces distortions to estimation and inference from pretesting. In other words, the draws of the data that survive a pretest are a selected sample from the true data-generationg process (DGP)

[Mogstad, Torgovitsky & Walters (2021)](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.20190221): The Causal Interpretation of Two-Stage Least Squares with Multiple Instrumental Variables
- Empirical researchers often combine multiple instrumental variables (IVs) for a single treatment using two-stage least squares (2SLS). When treatment effects are heterogeneous, a common justification for including multiple IVs is that the 2SLS estimand can be given a causal interpretation as a positively weighted average of local average treatment effects (LATE). This justification requires the well-known monotonicity condition.
- They show that with more than one instrument, this condition can only be satisfied if choice behavior is effectively homogeneous.
- Based on this finding, they consider the use of multiple IVs under a weaker, partial monotonicity condition. They characterize empirically verifiable sufficient and necessary conditions for the 2SLS estimand to be a positively weighted average of LATEs under partial monotonicity.
- They apply these results to an empirical analysis of the returns to college with multiple instruments. They show that the standard monotonicity condition is at odds with the data. Nevertheless, their empirical checks reveal that the 2SLS estimate retains a causal interpretation as a positively weighted average of the effects of college attendance among complier groups.

[Broderick, Giordano & Meager (2021)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14999.pdf): An Automatic Finite-Sample Robustness Metric: Can Dropping a Little Data Change Conclusions?
- They found a way to assess the robustness of regression results by removing a small number of observations
    - They invented a framework for selecting observations to remove such that they have the largest impact on the regression result
        - This method is called Approximate Maximum Influence Perturbation
- For the observations selected, the metric records the lower bound of the difference between the original estimator and the new estimator. Therefore, as long as the metric indicates a violation of robustness, the original estimator should be re-examined

    - Propose a novel estimator for the number of mixture components (denoted by M) in a non-parametric finite mixture model
    - Setting: The analyst has repeated observations of K >= 2 variables that are conditionally independent given a finitely supported latent variable with M support points
    - Condition: an integral operator T that is identified from the data has rank equal to M (under a mild assumption on the joint distribution of the observed and latent variables)
    - Propose: an estimator of M which consists of a thresholding rule that counts the number of singular values of a consistent estimator of T that are greater than a data-driven threshold.
    - Prove:

- Uses sampling to randomize choice when partial identification in statistical decision theory requires criteria such as minimax regret.


[Cattaneo, Cheung, Ma & Masatlioglu (2021)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.10650.pdf): Attention Overload
- They introduce an Attention Overload Model that captures the idea that alternatives compete for the decision marker's attention, and hence the attention frequency each alternative receives decreases as the choice problem becomes larger.
- Using this nonparametric restriction on the random attention formation, they show that a fruitful revealed preference theory can be developed, and provide testable implications on the observed choice behavior that can be used to partially identify the decision maker's preference.
- They also provide novel partial identification results on the underlying attention frequency, thereby offering the first nonparametric identification result of (a feature of) the random attention formation mechanism in the literature.
- Building on their partial identification results, for both preferences and attention frequency, they develop econometric methods for estimation and inference.
    - The procedures remain valid even in settings with large number of alternatives and choice problems.
- They also provide a software package in R implementing their empirical methods, and illustrate them in a simulation study.

### Discrete choice estimation
[Christensen, Moon, and Schorfheide (2022)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.11748.pdf): Optimal Discrete Decisions when Payoffs are Partially Identified
- Published in ArXiv
- This paper derives optimal statistical decision rules for discrete choice problems when the decision maker is unable to discriminate among a set of payoff distributions.
- The decision maker must confront both model uncertainty (about the identity of the true payoff distribution) and statistical uncertainty (the set of payoff distributions must be estimated)
- Efficient-robust decision rules, which minimize maximum risk or regret over the set of payoff distributions and which use the data to learn efficiently about features of the set of payoff distributions germane to the choice problem, are optimal and can dominate seemingly natural alternatives.
