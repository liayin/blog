- Title: Complementaries in High School and College Investments
- Objective: study the complementarities between multi-dimentional abilities, high school investments, and college investments in wages.
- First part: non-parametric evidence of the strong complementarities between abilities, high school investments and college investments.
- Second part: generalized Roy model that accounts for additional unobserved heterogeneity using within-school-across-cohort variation in specialization choices.
- Results: investing in more challenging tracks in high school increases college enrollment and graduation, but not necessarily wages.
