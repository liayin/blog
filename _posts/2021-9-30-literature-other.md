#### Labor

[Anelli & Koenig (2021)](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/fkoenig/The_willingness_to_pay21jul26.pdf)
- Model: WTP for health risk.
- Data: Homebase.
- Method: DiD. Comparing between people who are on either side of the $600 FPUC threshold based on state-specific criteria.
- Results: WTP is higher than the "Heroes pay" program offered.

[Humphries, Joensen & Veramendi (2019)](https://johnerichumphries.com/Humphries_Joensen_and_Veramendi_2018wp.pdf)
- Title: Complementaries in High School and College Investments
- Objective: study the complementarities between multi-dimentional abilities, high school investments, and college investments in wages.
- First part: non-parametric evidence of the strong complementarities between abilities, high school investments and college investments.
- Second part: generalized Roy model that accounts for additional unobserved heterogeneity using within-school-across-cohort variation in specialization choices.
- Results: investing in more challenging tracks in high school increases college enrollment and graduation, but not necessarily wages.

[Albert & Monras (2021)](https://joanmonras.weebly.com/uploads/7/6/7/9/76790475/city_size_migrant_wages_v44.pdf): Immigration and Spatial Equilibrium: The Role of Expenditures in the Country of Origin
- Document that international migrants concentrate more in expensive cities
- The more concentration, the lower the prices in their original countries are
- International migrants consume less locally than comparable natives
- Quantitative spatial equilibrium model
    - A part of immigrants' income goes towards consumption in their origin countries
- More efficient spatial allocation of labor
    - Increases aggregate output and welfare of natives

[Colas (2021)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12RBQeGmUefbAWa8ZzM6vULi5ehIE3lNz/view): The Indirect Fiscal Benets of Low-Skilled Immigration
- Low-skilled immigrants push locals to higher income brackets, thus increases tax revenue

#### Inequality
[Fernandez, Parsa & Viarengo (2021)](http://applied-microecon.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/files/2021/09/comingout_revision_september2021.pdf): Coming out in America: Thirty Years of Cultural Change
- Data: GSS
- Empirical strategy: DiD
- Conclusion: Greater exposure to the gay population, rather than expanding liberalism and civil liberties, lead to the increased acceptance of same-sex relationships.

[Athey, Ferguson, Gentzkow & Schmidt (2021)](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/118/46/e2026160118.full.pdf): Estimating experienced racial segregation in US cities using large-scale GPS data
- PNAS
- Experienced isolation: captures individuals' exposure to diverse others in the places they visit over the course of their days.

##### Gender Inequality
[Cabral & Dillender (2021)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w29541?utm_campaign=ntwh&utm_medium=email&utm_source=ntwg17): Gender Differences in Medical Evaluations: Evidence from Randomly Assigned Doctors
- Compared to differences among their male patient counterparts, female patients randomly assigned a female doctor rather than a male doctor are 5.0% more likely to be evaluated as disabled and receive 8.5% more subsequent cash benefits on average.
- The magnitude of these effects implies that having female doctors evaluate patients entirely offsets the observed gender gap in the likelihood of being evaluated as disabled when male doctors evaluate patients.

#### Trade
