- childhood home visiting program

[Anelli & Koenig (2021)](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/fkoenig/The_willingness_to_pay21jul26.pdf)
- Model: WTP for health risk.
- Data: Homebase.
- Method: DiD. Comparing between people who are on either side of the $600 FPUC threshold based on state-specific criteria.

[Humphries, Joensen & Veramendi (2019)](https://johnerichumphries.com/Humphries_Joensen_and_Veramendi_2018wp.pdf)
- Title: Complementaries in High School and College Investments
- Objective: study the complementarities between multi-dimentional abilities, high school investments, and college investments in wages.
- First part: non-parametric evidence of the strong complementarities between abilities, high school investments and college investments.
- Second part: generalized Roy model that accounts for additional unobserved heterogeneity using within-school-across-cohort variation in specialization choices.
- Results: investing in more challenging tracks in high school increases college enrollment and graduation, but not necessarily wages.

[Albert & Monras (2021)](https://joanmonras.weebly.com/uploads/7/6/7/9/76790475/city_size_migrant_wages_v44.pdf): Immigration and Spatial Equilibrium: The Role of Expenditures in the Country of Origin
- Document that international migrants concentrate more in expensive cities
- The more concentration, the lower the prices in their original countries are
- International migrants consume less locally than comparable natives
- Quantitative spatial equilibrium model
    - A part of immigrants' income goes towards consumption in their origin countries
- More efficient spatial allocation of labor
    - Increases aggregate output and welfare of natives

- Compared to differences among their male patient counterparts, female patients randomly assigned a female doctor rather than a male doctor are 5.0% more likely to be evaluated as disabled and receive 8.5% more subsequent cash benefits on average.
- The magnitude of these effects implies that having female doctors evaluate patients entirely offsets the observed gender gap in the likelihood of being evaluated as disabled when male doctors evaluate patients.

### Law
[Lane, Nosenzo, and Sonderegger (2023)](doi.org/10.1257/aer.20210970): Law and Norms: Empirical Evidence
- Abstract: A large theoretical literature argues laws exert a causal effect on norms, but empirical evidence remains scant. Using a novel identification strategy, we provide a compelling empirical test of this proposition. We use incentivized vignette experiments to directly measure social norms relating to actions subject to legal thresholds. Our large-scale experiments (n = 7,000) run in the United Kingdom, United States, and China show that laws can causally influence social norms. Results are robust across different samples and methods of measuring norms, and are consistent with a model of social image concerns where individuals care about the inferences others make about their underlying prosociality.

### IO

Wang (2023)
- Title: Subsidizing industry growth in a market with lemons: Evidence from the electric market in China
- Abstract:The growth of a new infant industry is a combined result of firm competition and support from government policies. Three forces shape the dynamics of a nascent industry. First, firms continue to enter the industry, which leads to market structure changes determined by the underlying sunk cost of entry. Second, technology growth and upstream spillovers improve the industry’s cost structure. Third, for a consumer goods industry, consumer learning and the associated reputation-building dynamics are crucial for the industry’s development. Consumers could accept a product and gradually increase adoption if the industry builds a reputation for good quality. This paper examines the interaction of these three forces in the Chinese electric vehicle market and identifies how subsidies and other policy instruments affect industry growth through the three forces, with a focus on reputational concerns.

### Experiments

### Education
[Angrist, Gray-Lobe, Idoux, and Pathak (2022)](https://doi.org/10.3386/w30308): Still Worth the Trip? School Busing Effects in Boston and New York
- NBER working paper
- Busing increases integration but not achievement (SAT scores)
- Counterfactual shows cost saving from not busing
- LY: this may be discussed in the paper, but integration itself may build social capital, which is not measured by achievement. Perhaps if they could link the data to tax records, they can see the effect of busing on earnings. If they link it to the Census data, they can see the effect on family structure. Though the linking can be time-consuming, if not infeasible.
