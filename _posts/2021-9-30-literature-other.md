#### Labor

[Anelli & Koenig (2021)](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/fkoenig/The_willingness_to_pay21jul26.pdf)
- Model: WTP for health risk.
- Data: Homebase.
- Method: DiD. Comparing between people who are on either side of the $600 FPUC threshold based on state-specific criteria.
- Results: WTP is higher than the "Heroes pay" program offered.

[Humphries, Joensen & Veramendi (2019)](https://johnerichumphries.com/Humphries_Joensen_and_Veramendi_2018wp.pdf)
- Title: Complementaries in High School and College Investments
- Objective: study the complementarities between multi-dimentional abilities, high school investments, and college investments in wages.
- First part: non-parametric evidence of the strong complementarities between abilities, high school investments and college investments.
- Second part: generalized Roy model that accounts for additional unobserved heterogeneity using within-school-across-cohort variation in specialization choices.
- Results: investing in more challenging tracks in high school increases college enrollment and graduation, but not necessarily wages.

[Albert & Monras (2021)](https://joanmonras.weebly.com/uploads/7/6/7/9/76790475/city_size_migrant_wages_v44.pdf): Immigration and Spatial Equilibrium: The Role of Expenditures in the Country of Origin
- Document that international migrants concentrate more in expensive cities
- The more concentration, the lower the prices in their original countries are
- International migrants consume less locally than comparable natives
- Quantitative spatial equilibrium model
    - A part of immigrants' income goes towards consumption in their origin countries
- More efficient spatial allocation of labor
    - Increases aggregate output and welfare of natives

#### Inequality
[Fernandez, Parsa & Viarengo (2021)](http://applied-microecon.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/files/2021/09/comingout_revision_september2021.pdf): Coming out in America: Thirty Years of Cultural Change
- Data: GSS
- Empirical strategy: DiD
- Conclusion: Greater exposure to the gay population, rather than expanding liberalism and civil liberties, lead to the increased acceptance of same-sex relationships.


#### Trade

[Eaton & Kortum (2002)](http://www.lukasz-drozd.com/uploads/4/3/1/8/43183209/econ871notes_tex.pdf)
- Built on Ricardian model
- Continuum of goods due to DFS (1977)
- Multicountry
- Tractable - good for making policy recommendations

#### IO

[Ciliberto, Murry & Tamer (2021)](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/715848)
- Model for estimating a game of simultaneous entry and pricing decisions while allowing for correlations between unobserved cost and demand shocks
- Account for selection in the pricing stage.
- Applied to merge situation

[Goel (2021)](https://kritikagoel.github.io/research/)
- Use Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs) to analyze the welfare effects of market segmentation from third-degree price discrimination.
    - Allowing manufacturers' product offerings to be endogenously determined
- Uniform price can increase hospital surplus by up to 3.4%
    - Purchases of ICDs equipped with a superior technology drops by up to 26.3%

#### Blockchain

[Makarov & Schoar (2021)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w29396?utm_campaign=ntwh&utm_medium=email&utm_source=ntwg17): Blockchain Analysis of the Bitcoin Market
- Provides detailed analyses of the Bitcoin network and its main participants
- Built a novel database using a large number of public and proprietary sources to link Bitcoin addresses to real entities
- Develop an extensive suite of algorithms to extract information about the behavior of the main market participants
- Three major pieces of analysis of the Bitcoin eco-system
    - Analyze the transaction volume and network structure of the main participants on the blockchain
    - Document the concentration and regional composition of the miners
    - Analyze the ownership concentration of the largest holders of Bitcoin
