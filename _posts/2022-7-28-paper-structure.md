In economics, there are broadly two types of papers, empirical papers and theoretical papers. This article covers the structure of empirical papers.

Empirical papers in economics usually contain the following sections ([Reference 1](https://twp.duke.edu/sites/twp.duke.edu/files/file-attachments/econ.original.pdf), [Reference 2](https://www.csus.edu/indiv/v/vangaasbeckk/resources/writing/comp.htm)):
- Title
- Abstract
    - Research question
    - My contribution
    - How I answer the question
    - Results
- Introduction
    - Research question
    - Motivate
    - Where my research fit
    - Identify my contribution
    - Summarize how I intend to answer the research question
    - State my general results and answer to my research question
- Literature Review
    - General assessment of the literature (abundant, not much, focus on methodological issues, etc.)
    - Describe the aspects of the literature that are most relevant to your study
- Empirical model/empirical methodology
    - Model
        - make predictions of what you expect to find in the data
    - Analysis
        - Data
            - Identify and describe the source, explain why the source was used
            - Identify any caveats (e.g. the data over-represents a certain demographic population)
        - Preliminary data analysis
            - Summary stats
            - Histograms
            - Time series plots
            - Other similar information
        - Regression
            - Regression equation
            - Discussion justifying this equation
            - Description of the expected signs of the coefficients for each of the explanatory variables
            - Make clear connections back to the theory section and the literature review section
- Results
    - Open with an overview of what results will be presented
    - Present results
    - Explain why these results are interesting
- Conclusion
    - Restate the research question, describe what we know about this research question from the literature, and briefly describe the theoretical answer to the question
    - Answer the research question based on empirical analysis, compare findings to the consensus in the literature, pointing out possible reasons for differences and similarities. 
    - Policy implications and point toward directions for future research
