    - Toward this end, we employ interrupted time series modeling techniques to assess the impact of Oklahoma’s Stand Your Ground Law on the number of residential and non-residential burglaries. The findings indicate that while the legislative initiative achieved its manifest goal of reducing the number of residential burglaries, it simultaneously had the unintended consequence of increasing the number of non-residential burglaries.

    - Abstract: Using data from three of the largest cities in the United States, we compare observed crime concentration to a counterfactual distribution of crimes generated by randomizing crimes to street segments. We show that this method avoids a key pitfall that causes a popular method of measuring crime concentration to considerably overstate the degree of crime concentration in a city.

    - In 2001, a large and sustained supply shock halted a heroin epidemic in Australia. We use outpatient drug treatment records to identify individuals who accounted for nearly half of opioid overdoses prior to the shock, and examine how the reduced supply of heroin affected their health and criminal activity over the next eight years. Initially, the gains from fewer overdose deaths are offset by individuals substituting to other drugs and committing more violent crime, including homicides. Most adverse effects dissipate after one year, and are followed by further decreases in deaths and a large reduction in property crime. Our results demonstrate that reducing the supply of illicit opioids can lead to meaningful longer-term improvements, even when the short-term effects are ambiguous.

Fostering and crime:
- [Norris, Pecenco & Weaver (2021)](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/aer.20190415): The Effects of Parental and Sibling Incarceration: Evidence from Ohio
    - Every year, millions of Americans experience the incarceration of a family member. Using 30 years of administrative data from Ohio and exploiting differing incarceration propensities of randomly assigned judges, this paper provides the first quasi-experimental estimates of the effects of parental and sibling incarceration in the United States. Parental incarceration has beneficial effects on some important outcomes for children, reducing their likelihood of incarceration by 4.9 percentage points and improving their adult neighborhood quality. While estimates on academic performance and teen parenthood are imprecise, we reject large positive or negative effects. Sibling incarceration leads to similar reductions in criminal activity.

- [Hemenway & Solnick (2015)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25910555/)
    - Objectives: To describe the epidemiology of self-defense gun use (SDGU) and the relative effectiveness of SDGU in preventing injury and property loss.

    - Methods: Data come from the National Crime Victimization Survey for 2007-2011, focusing on personal contact crimes. For property loss, we examined incidents where the intent was to steal property. Multivariate analyses controlled for age, gender of offender and victim, if offender had a gun, urbanicity, and thirteen types of self-protective action.

    - Results: Of over 14,000 incidents in which the victim was present, 127 (0.9%) involved a SDGU. SDGU was more common among males, in rural areas, away from home, against male offenders and against offenders with a gun. After any protective action, 4.2% of victims were injured; after SDGU, 4.1% of victims were injured. In property crimes, 55.9% of victims who took protective action lost property, 38.5 of SDGU victims lost property, and 34.9% of victims who used a weapon other than a gun lost property.

    - Conclusions: Compared to other protective actions, the National Crime Victimization Surveys provide little evidence that SDGU is uniquely beneficial in reducing the likelihood of injury or property loss.

Law's unintended consequences:
- [Podkopacz & Feld](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1144155.pdf): "Extended Jurisdiction Juvenile Prosecution" written into law in Minnesota in 1995 attempts to create a buffer zone before sending juvenile offenders to adult corrections facilities. However, many juvenile offenders were still sent to adult prison due to technical parole violations ("back-door" route to prison).

Policing:
- [Abrams, Fang & Goonetilleke(2021)](https://conference.nber.org/conf_papers/f158125.pdf): The standard economic model of police stops implies that the contraband hit rate should rise when the number of stops falls, ceteris paribus. We provide empirical corroboration of such optimizing models of police behavior by examining changes in stops and frisks around two extraordinary events of 2020 - the pandemic onset and the nationwide protests following the killing of George Floyd. We find that hit rates from pedestrian and vehicle stops generally rose as stops and frisks fell dramatically. Using detailed data, we are able to rule out a number of alternative explanations, including changes in street population, crime, police allocation, and policing intensity. We find mixed evidence about the changes in racial disparities, and evidence that police stops do not decrease crime, at least in the short run. The results are robust to a number of different specifications. Our findings provide quantitative estimates that can contribute to the important goals of improving and reforming policing.

    - Abstract: We estimate the degree to which individual police officers practice racial discrimination. Using a bunching estimation design and data from the Florida Highway Patrol, we show that minorities are less likely to receive a discount on their speeding tickets than White drivers. Disaggregating this difference to the individual police officer, we estimate that 42 percent of officers practice discrimination. We then apply our officer-level discrimination measures to various policy-relevant questions in the literature. In particular, reassigning officers across locations based on their lenience can effectively reduce the aggregate disparity in treatment.

    - Abstract: Nearly 1,000 officer-involved killings occur each year in the United States. This article documents the large, racially disparate effects of these events on the educational and psychological well-being of Los Angeles public high school students. Exploiting hyperlocal variation in how close students live to a killing, I find that exposure to police violence leads to persistent decreases in GPA, increased incidence of emotional disturbance, and lower rates of high school completion and college enrollment. These effects are driven entirely by black and Hispanic students in response to police killings of other minorities and are largest for incidents involving unarmed individuals.

- [Cubukcu, Sahin, Tekin & Topalli](https://www.nber.org/papers/w29019): "Body-Worn Cameras and Adjudication of Citizen Complaints of Plice Misconduct", NBER Working Paper
    - Abstract: Police body-worn cameras (BWCs) have been the subject of much research on how the technology’s enhanced documentation of police/citizen interactions impact police behavior. Less attention has been paid to how BWC recordings affect the adjudication of citizen complaints against the police. We employ citizen complaint data from the Chicago Police Department and Civilian Office of Police Accountability filed between 2012-2020 to determine the extent to which BWC footage enhances the efficacy of evidence used to formulate a conclusion of responsibility, and whether bias against complainants based on race would subsequently be reduced. Accordingly, we exploit the staggered deployment of BWCs across 22 Chicago police districts over time to estimate the effect of BWCs on these outcomes. Our findings indicate that BWCs led to a significant decrease in the dismissal of investigations due to insufficient evidence ("not sustained") as well as a significant increase in disciplinary actions against police officers ("sustained" outcomes”) with sufficient evidence to sanction their misconduct. We further find that disparities in complaints across racial groups for the “unsustained” category fade away with the implementation of BWCs.

Race & Criminal Justice System:
- [Feigenberg & Miller (2021)](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/pol.20180688): "Racial Divisions and Criminal Justice: Evidence from Southern State Courts"
    - The US criminal justice system is exceptionally punitive. We test whether racial heterogeneity is one cause, exploiting cross-jurisdiction variation in punishment severity in four Southern states. We estimate the causal effect of jurisdiction on arrest outcomes using a fixed effects model that incorporates extensive charge and defendant controls. We validate our estimates using defendants charged in multiple jurisdictions. Consistent with a model of ingroup bias in electorate preferences, the relationship between local severity and Black population share follows an inverted U-shape. Within states, defendants are 27–54 percent more likely to be incarcerated in “peak” heterogeneous jurisdictions than in homogeneous jurisdictions. We estimate that confinement rates and race-based confinement rate gaps would fall by 15 percent if all jurisdictions adopted the severity of homogeneous jurisdictions within their state.

Prisons
- [Mukherjee (2021)](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/pol.20170474): "Impacts of Private Prison Contracting on Inmate Time Served and Recidivism"
    - This paper examines the impact of private prison contracting by exploiting staggered prison capacity shocks in Mississippi. Motivated by a model based on the typical private prison contract that pays a per diem for each occupied bed, the empirical analysis shows that private prison inmates serve 90 additional days. This is alternatively estimated as 4.8 percent of the average sentence. The delayed release erodes half of the cost savings offered by private contracting and is linked to the greater likelihood of conduct violations in private prisons. The additional days served do not lead to apparent changes in inmate recidivism. (JEL H76, K42)


Use of Google Trends Data:
- [Brodeur et al (2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720302103): COVID-19, lockdowns and well-being: Evidence from Google Trends
  - We look at the effect of COVID-19 and associated lockdowns on population well-being.
  - We use Google Trends data to measure changes in well-being related topic search-terms.
  - We find an increase in searches for boredom, loneliness, worry and sadness.
  - We find a decrease in searches for stress, suicide and divorce.
  - We see evidence of mean-reversion in some (but not all) of the well-being measures.

MTV’s 16 and Pregnant on Teen Childbearing
  - We supplement this analysis with an exploration of data about online activity to 
determine whether the MTV show influenced viewers’ interest in the topics of birth 
control and abortion, in so far as it is reflected in their Internet search and social 
media activity. In particular, we examine the potential influence of 16 and Pregnant
on teens’ decision-making process with data on the frequency with which teens search for terms like “how to get birth control” or use the terms “birth control” or “abortion” in their tweets. This analysis provides some insight into the mechanisms 
that would lead to changes in rates of teen childbearing in the absence of sufficient data on actual levels of sexual activity and contraceptive use.

- [Jetter & Molina (2020)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wxvoex9m7mv7sxj/philspeech.pdf): Persuasive agenda-setting: Rodrigo Duterte's inauguration speech and drugs in the Philippines
    - Exploring the elusive agenda-setting hypothesis pertaining to democratically-elected leaders, we hypothesize that Duterte’s 2016 inauguration speech systematically shifted Filipinos’ policy agenda to prioritizing illegal drugs. In a country that tops internet usage worldwide, we study daily Google searches on the national and regional level, identifying a strong and persistent increase in drug-related searches right after the speech, both in absolute terms and relative to other prominent policy topics. Further estimations rule out alternative explanations, including Duterte’s election campaign, potentially confounding topics (i.e., pharmaceutical drugs, Duterte’s ‘War on Drugs’), and common international time trends. Complementing Google search data, individual-level surveys also reveal more respondents considered crime reduction the top national priority right after the speech. To better identify causality, we exploit the historical timing of local festivals, leaving some provinces less exposed to the speech. Results show less-exposed provinces exhibit smaller increases in drug-related Google searches and survey-elicited crime prioritization.
