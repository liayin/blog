Jupyter Lab is a tool for editing and running Python code. One advantage over Jupyter Notebook is the ability to incorporate extended functionalities such as Git. Others include the ability to open consoles and terminals. It also has its own file system.

After installation, the way to use Jupyter Lab is to navigate to the folder of interest in Anaconda Prompt and type in "jupyter lab." If you use Google Chrome's InCognito browser or Microsoft Edge's InPrivate browser, you need to configure it to open it in the specific type of browser that you use.
