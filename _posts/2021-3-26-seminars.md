[Inference with Many Weak Instruments](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-yas_cspytrr9r1iDR-yPyOVnNefpBqN/view?usp=sharing)

We develop a concept of weak identification in linear IV models in which the number of instruments can grow at the same rate or slower than the sample size. We propose a jackknifed version of the classical weak identification-robust Anderson-Rubin (AR) test statistic. Large-sample inference based on the jackknifed AR is valid under heteroscedasticity and weak identication. The feasible version of this statistic uses a novel variance estimator. The test has uniformly correct size and good power properties. We also develop a pre-test for weak identification that is related to the size property of a Wald test based on the Jackknife Instrumental Variable Estimator. This new pre-test is valid under heteroscedasticity and with many instruments.

Dynamic Regression Discontinuity Under Treatment Effect Heterogeneity
- Regression discontinuity (RD) is a popular tool for the analysis of economic policies or treatment interventions. This paper extends the classic static RD model to a dynamic framework, where observations are eligible for repeated RD eligibility tests and, therefore, treatments. Such kinds of dynamics complicate the identification and estimation of longer-term average treatment effects. Previous empirical research with such designs typically ignored the dynamics in the model or adopted restrictive identifying assumptions. This paper lays out the dynamic RD model using the potential outcome framework and proposes nonparametric and semiparametric identification and estimation strategies under various assumptions. The proposed methods are applied to revisit the effect of local school bonds in the seminal study of Cellini et al. (2010). Estimated effects are qualitatively similar or somewhat larger than reported in Cellini et al. (2010).

[Civil Rights Restoration and Recidivism](https://sites.google.com/view/hannahoover/research?authuser=0)

Florida is currently one of only a handful of states that does not restore civil rights upon completion of a sentence for felons. Instead, persons with a prior felony conviction must apply for civil rights restoration through a constitutionally authorized process known as clemency. Civil rights revocation not only revokes the right to vote, but also denies eligibility of certain occupational licenses and state-funded scholarships. Over the past 26 years, the Rules of Executive Clemency have been amended such that approval became automatic for those eligible between 2007 to 2011. Outside of this time period, however, clemency required an application, hearing, and a mandatory waiting period. It is unknown, a priori, if such policy changes influenced labor market outcomes, voting behavior, or educational attainment, any of which may affect incentives for convicted felons to re-offend. As an aggregate measure of these channels, I analyze the casual link between civil rights restoration and rates of recidivism. To establish causality, this paper uses changes in the Rules of Executive Clemency affecting ex-felons' ability to restore their civil rights in order to identify the impact of civil rights restoration on rates of recidivism.

[Mobbed Up: Control of Labor Unions as Cartel Enforcement](https://sites.google.com/site/mtroyamartinez/research)

After select counties enforced Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), they see a statistically significant rise in the number of new establishments and employment. The paper attributes it to the successful removal of mafia influence in these locations.

Monetizing victim suffering due to violence

Abstract: Efficiency calculations of violence prevention are likely to be severely biased if the hard-to-measure value of utility reductions due to victimization are not included. We measure the monetary compensation needed to offset the welfare loss associated with being subjected to violence, by applying the compensating-income-variation method to data from an Icelandic health-and-lifestyle survey carried out in 2017. We examine differences in the monetary compensation needed by (i) types of violence, (ii) duration since the exposure, and (iii) the relationship with the perpetrator. Our results show that the cost associated with the welfare loss of violence is highest when the violence psychological, the perpetrator is a spouse or an ex-spouse, and when the violence happened recently.

Recidivism and Neighborhood Institutions: Evidence from the Rise of the Evangelical Church in Chile

Abstract: Rehabilitating convicted criminals is challenging and an important share of convicted criminals return to prison only a few years after their release. Thus, finding effective ways of encouraging crime desistance has become an important policy goal to reduce crime and incarceration rates. This paper provides causal evidence that the local institutions of the neighborhood where individuals return after prison matter. Specifically, we show that the opening of an Evangelical church reduces twelve-months re-incarceration rates among property crime offenders by more than 10 percentage points. This effect represents a drop of 16% in the probability of returning to prison for this group of individuals. We find smaller and less precise effects for more severe types of crime. We discuss two classes of mechanisms that could explain our results: religiosity and social support. We provide evidence that the social support provided by evangelical churches is an important driver of our results. This suggests that non-religious local institutions could also play an important role in the rehabilitation of former inmates.

[Do Police Make Too Many Arrests?](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ci-U6Y3Exjj7AtyEPPat_lcHdOAfaHT6/view)

We ask whether reductions in arrests increase crime, a central question in the current debate about police reform in the United States. Identifying this causal effect is difficult, as changes in arrests are nonrandom and often reflect or coincide with changes in crime. We study changes in arrests after line-of-duty deaths of officers, events that are likely to impact peer police behavior through increased fear of job risk or emotional distress but are unlikely to directly affect civilian criminal activity or community trust. We document that officer deaths are not preceded by changes in crime within cities, indicating that their timing is plausibly exogenous. These deaths lead to short-term but significant reductions in arrests of all types, with the largest reductions in more discretionary arrests for lower level offenses. Despite this drop in arrest activity, we find no evidence of an increase in crime. Moreover, there does not appear to be a threshold level or duration of reduced arrest activity past which crime increases. Our findings suggest that police departments may be able to reduce marginal enforcement without incurring public safety costs.
