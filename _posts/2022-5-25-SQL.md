The code for dealing with odd/even numbers in SQL is below. The code comes from [here](https://tableplus.com/blog/2019/09/select-rows-odd-even-value.html)
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM table_name 
WHERE mod(column_name,2) = 0;
```

Group by two columns
```sql
SELECT creator_id
FROM all_donations
GROUP BY creator_id, viewer_id
```

Sub table
```sql
SELECT creator_id
FROM (
    SELECT creator_id, SUM(donation_amount)
    FROM all_donations
) AS s
...
```

Sort
```sql
ORDER BY
```

The window function is a more advanced technique in SQL. [Here](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-window-functions/) is a good resource for learning about the window function. The important commands such as `order` and `partition` define what is referred to as the "window".
