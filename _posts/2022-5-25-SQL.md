The code for dealing with odd/even numbers in SQL is below. The code comes from [here](https://tableplus.com/blog/2019/09/select-rows-odd-even-value.html)
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM table_name 
WHERE mod(column_name,2) = 0;
```


The window function is a more advanced technique in SQL. [Here](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-window-functions/) is a good resource for learning about the window function. The important commands such as `order` and `partition` define what is referred to as the "window".
