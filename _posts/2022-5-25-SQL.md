This post includes some commonly used code snippets.

## To make a database and table:
```sql
create database candidates;
use candidates;
create table candidateColleges(
    college_id int PRIMARY KEY, 
    candidate_name varchar(100));
desc candidateColleges;
INSERT INTO candidateColleges (college_id, candidate_name)
VALUES
    (123456, 'john_smith'),
    (123456, 'sarah_daniels'),
    (123457, 'tim_cook'),
    (123457, 'lisa_perelli'),
    (123457, 'jenny_west'),
    (123457, 'karl_tran'),
    (123457, 'tammy_turner');
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales (
	sale_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    store_id INT,
    date DATETIME
);
INSERT INTO sales (sale_id, product_id, store_id, date)
VALUES
	(1, 31331, 91110, '2020-2-20'),
    (1, 31331, 91110, '2020-2-20'),
    (2, 34611, 57507, '2020-2-20'),
	(3, 26583, 37340, '2020-2-20'),
	(3, 34611, 32016, '2020-2-20'),
	(3, 20267, 99525, '2020-2-21'),
	(4, 31331, 99525, '2020-2-21'),
	(5, 49760, 99525, '2020-2-21'),
	(6, 34611, 57507, '2020-2-21'),
	(7, 31331, 91110, '2020-2-21');
```

## Odd/even numbers
The code for dealing with odd/even numbers in SQL is below. The code comes from [here](https://tableplus.com/blog/2019/09/select-rows-odd-even-value.html)
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM table_name 
WHERE mod(column_name,2) = 0;
```

## Group by 
### Group by two columns
```sql
SELECT creator_id
FROM all_donations
GROUP BY creator_id, viewer_id
```

## Sub table
```sql
SELECT creator_id
FROM (
    SELECT creator_id, SUM(donation_amount)
    FROM all_donations
) AS s
...
```

## Sort
```sql
ORDER BY
```

## Window functions
The window function is a more advanced technique in SQL. [Here](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-window-functions/) is a good resource for learning about the window function. The important commands such as `order` and `partition` define what is referred to as the "window".

### Select top n values
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
LIMIT number;
```

### Lag
```sql
SELECT employee_ID, 
	salary, 
	year,
	LAG(salary, 1) OVER
		(PARTITION BY employee_ID ORDER BY year) AS lag_salary
FROM employee_salaries
```

## Change values
```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```
