# The consumer decision
The utility of consumer $$i$$ if he were to buy product $$j$$ in town $$t$$ is given by:

$$u_{ijt} = \alpha_i(y_i - p_{jt}) + \mathbf{x_{jt}\beta_i} + \xi_{jt} + \epsilon_{ijt}$$

where $$i$$ = 1,...,400, $$j$$ = 1,...,50, $$t$$ = 1,...,20.

$$y_i$$: income of consumer $$i$$ \
$$p_{jt}$$: observed price of product $$j$$ in town $$t$$ \
$$x_{jt}$$: 6-dimentional vector of observed characteristics of product $$j$$ in town $$t$$ \
$$\xi_{jt}$$: disturbance scalar summarizing unobserved characteristics of product $$j$$ in town $$t$$ \
$$\epsilon_{ijt}$$: usual unobserved disturbance with mean zero

Parameters to be estimated are consumer $$i$$'s marginal utility of income, $$\alpha_i$$, and his marginal utility of product characteristics, the 6-vector $$\mathbf{\beta_i}$$.
