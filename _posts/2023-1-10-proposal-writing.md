Academics often write a project proposal before they carry out a project in order to have an overview of all the steps required. They can also use the proposal to apply for research funding. Below, I will describe the common structure of a proposal for an empirical analysis project ([Reference](https://shoshanavasserman.com/files/2022/research_pitch_template.pdf)).

1. Research question
2. Institutional setting
3. Data & feasibility
4. Research design
5. Planning
