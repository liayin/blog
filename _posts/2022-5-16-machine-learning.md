Machine learning has been widely adopted to predict outcomes based on existing data. This blog post links to resources on the most common machine learning algorithms.

# Random Forest
Splitting criterion minimizes the Gini impurity (in the case of classification) and the SSE (in case of regression). ([Reference](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/random-forest.html))

Splitting criterion optimizes for finding splits associated with group heterogeneity.

# Causal Random Forest

Splitting criterion optimizes for finding splits associated with treatment effect heterogeneity.
