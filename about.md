Welcome to my blog! My name is Lia Yin and I'm a doctoral candidate in Economics at Boston College. This blog primarily hosts references and bookmarks that are helpful for my research. For example, it has snippets related to my projects, technical details related to statistics/econometrics/machine learning, and tips for using software such as Stata, Python, and LaTeX. I hope some of the information can be helpful to you, too.

Feel free to explore the blog and please cite the source if you would like to reproduce content from here. Thank you for visiting!
