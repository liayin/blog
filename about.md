I'm a Ph.D. in Economics at Boston College. This blog is a place where I store information about my research. It contains snippets of research-related information as well as tips for using software such as Stata, Python, and LaTeX.

Please feel free to explore the blog and please cite the source if you would like to reproduce the contents. Also, please excuse me for the language used, since I am mainly compiling information for personal use. Thank you for visiting!
